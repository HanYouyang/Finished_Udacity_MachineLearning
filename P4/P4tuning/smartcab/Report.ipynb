    "# Smart cab report\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "The smartcab operates in an ideal, grid-like city (similar to New York City), with roads going in the North-South and East-West directions. Other vehicles will certainly be present on the road, but there will be no pedestrians to be concerned with. At each intersection there is a traffic light that either allows traffic in the North-South direction or the East-West direction. U.S. Right-of-Way rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "> On a green light, a left turn is permitted if there is no oncoming traffic making a right turn or coming straight through the intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> On a red light, a right turn is permitted if no oncoming traffic is approaching from your left through the intersection. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "Assume that the smartcab is assigned a route plan based on the passengers’ starting location and destination. The route is split at each intersection into waypoints, and you may assume that the smartcab, at any instant, is at some intersection in the world. Therefore, the next waypoint to the destination, assuming the destination has not already been reached, is one intersection away in one direction (North, South, East, or West). \n",
    "\n",
    "The smartcab has only an egocentric view of the intersection it is at: It can determine the state of the traffic light for its direction of movement, and whether there is a vehicle at the intersection for each of the oncoming directions. For each action, the smartcab may either idle at the intersection, or drive to the next intersection to the left, right, or ahead of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each trip has a time to reach the destination which decreases for each action taken (the passengers want to get there quickly). If the allotted time becomes zero before reaching the destination, the trip has failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards and Goal\n",
    "The smartcab receives a reward for each successfully completed trip, and also receives a smaller reward for each action it executes successfully that obeys traffic rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "The smartcab receives a small penalty for any incorrect action, and a larger penalty for any action that violates traffic rules or causes an accident with another vehicle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the rewards and penalties the smartcab receives, the self-driving agent implementation should learn an optimal policy for driving on the city roads while obeying traffic rules, avoiding accidents, and reaching passengers’ destinations in the allotted time."

    "### Task 1: Implement a Basic Driving Agent\n",
    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "> The next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (None, 'forward', 'left', 'right') at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, enforce_deadline to False and observe how it performs."
